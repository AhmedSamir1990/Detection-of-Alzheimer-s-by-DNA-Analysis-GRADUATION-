Project: Our project is about detecting Alzheimer's by analyzing the DNA. We used two different approaches (WGS, SNPs) but we setteled for one. We used the SNPs to check for Alzheimer's. The aim of this project is to collect healthy patients and patients who carry Alzheimer's and try to predict the potential ones. We have some charchterisitics as gender, age, and sex in the database.
